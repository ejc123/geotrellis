    * FastMapHistogram only works with integer values, which is great for performance
    * but means that, in order to use FastMapHistogram with double values, each value 
    * must be multiplied by a power of ten to preserve significant fractional digits.
    *
    * For example, if you want to save one significant digit (2.1 from 2.123), set
    * sigificantDigits to 1, and the histogram will save 2.1 as "21" by multiplying
    * each value by 10.  The multiplier is 10 raised to the power of significant digits
    * (e.g. 1 digit: 10, 2 digits: 100, and so on).
    *
    * Important: Be sure that the maximum value in the rater multiplied by 
    *            10 ^ significantDigits does not overflow Int.MaxValue (2, 147, 483, 647). 
    *
    * @param significantDigits   Number of significant digits to preserve by multiplying
