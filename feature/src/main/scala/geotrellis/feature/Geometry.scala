  // boundary
  // intersection ( & )
  // union ( | )
  // difference ( - )

  // crosses
  // within
  // contains - opposite of within

  // vertices - line, polygon; doesn't make much sense for a point
  // envelope - line, polygon; again, doesn't make sense for points since it just returns the point
  // boundingBox - same thing as envelope
  // length - line; points have length 0.0
  // perimeter - length of a polygon

  // isSimple - always true for valid polygons and empty geoms; true for points as well; false for MultiPoints with repeated points
  // overlaps - geoms must have same dimension and not all points in common and intersection of interiors has same dimension as geoms themselves - done for P/L/A
