   * in a block and yInc is the number of rows of tiles that can fit in a block. If xInc > -1 
   * then yInc can't be > 1. 
   * 
   * The rules are:
   * 1. If the total number of tiles is less than that can fit onto a block, we return [-1,-1]. 
   * This means no splits would be generated. 
   * 2. If the row is too wide for a single hdfs block, we return [X, 1] where X is estimated
   * using tilesPerBlock and compression factor.   
   * 3. Otherwise, we figure how many roles of tiles can fit onto a block, so we return [-1, Y]
   * using tilesPerBlock and compression factor.
